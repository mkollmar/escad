Writing escad expansions is not difficult. Go through following steps carefully and
you will have a good basis for writing your own.


Following code is a minimal expansion:

-----EXAMPLE START-----

(in-package "COMMON-LISP-USER")
(defpackage :de.markus-herbert-kollmar.escad.expansion.hello_world
  (:use :common-lisp :escad)
  (:export :my-function)
  (:documentation "This is my expansion which does nothing usefull."))
(in-package :de.markus-herbert-kollmar.escad.expansion.hello_world)
(defun my-function (symbol-name-string)
  "This function will be executed by calling this expansion.")

-----EXAMPLE END-----

Following things you should keep in mind:

* Choose namespace.
* Provide documentation within your expansion.
* Provide at least one function which can be called with the symbol-name-string as first argument und some possible further arguments.
* Provide a taxonomy file with your expansion declaration or request that your expansion will be taken into the default escad-taxonomy.


Thanks
