# Overview about escad #

ESCAD means **E** xpandable **s** ymbolic **c** omputer **a** ided **d** descrition.

Escad is planed to...
  * describe every domain in our world (processes, family-relations,...)
  * let you concentrate on the semantic of a topic, not at the graphical representation as in some ordinary diagramm editors.
  * generate different output (graphs, list's, graphical family-tree's, circuit-drawings...)
  * be expandable to your domain through expansions.
  * support you in editing and querying of description data.
  * be usable/scriptable through Common-LISP (no additional libarys needed for basic use).
  * be practical.
  * be flexible.
  * be a text-based user interface (however one could implement a graphical user interface as client whereby escad will be a server).
  * provides a standard taxonomy-tree to make data interchange easy, but you also can use/mix your own taxonomy.

Escad has not the goal to
  * be a drawing tool.
  * be a pure academic tool.
