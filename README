1. INTRODUCTION
***************

Hello, and welcome to ESCAD.

ESCAD stands for <E>xtendable <S>ymbolic <C>omputer <A>ided <D>escription.
It is a tool which allows you to model parts of the real world in symbolic form.
Therefore it uses 2 objects:
 - Symbols
 - Relations.

Symbols represent things or processes in the real world. For example a "man" could be a symbol.
Relations represent relations between the symbols. For example "is_friend_of" could be a relation between to "man"-symbols.
The whole system is extendable through expansions.



2. USAGE
********

Quickstart
----------
In order to use escad, just load the lisp file.


Help to help
------------
Follow commands are currently supported by escad:

cs cls cos export-dot export-svg help lov lr ls mr ms nr ns r rr rs s sc ss sav tv.

You can get the help to each command if you read the documentation string:
(documentation 'ls 'function)  ; gives the documentation of the command "ls".


Glossary
--------
Following explanations of terms will probably help you in further use:

VIEW: place (server, file, device,...) which contains SCHEMATIC data.
SCHEMATIC: combinations of symbols and relations in a view which can also contain references to other VIEWS.
OBJECT: SYMBOL or RELATION.
OBJECT-PROPERTY: All information a OBJECT contains. It's name is no property, it is it's idendity.
URI (see rfc3986): specifies what kind of physic media the data is stored.
DOMAIN: seperate namespace which groups OBJECT's or SCHEMATIC's. A DOMAIN name
SYMBOL: object which represents/models something (state, thing, process,...) the editor want. 
RELATION: object which represents/models a relationship between SYMBOLS.
CONTEXT: The set of symbols and relations which are directly related to a symbol or relation.
DATA: additional property of a object which is used mostly for representation tasks. In order to get
      some effect of this data, you need a function for each data.
EXPANSION: special symbol which has special functions and which can automatically generate things in DATA property.


Usage-examples
--------------
For fast usage, here is a short introductional work-flow, which covers some basic tasks you
may do with escad:

(ls)  ; shows all currently existing symbols
(ns "Man")  ; creates a new symbol with name "Man"
(ns "Man2")  ; creates a new symbol with name "Man2"
(nr "is_friend_of" "Man" "Man2")  ; creates a new relation "is_friend_of" from symbol "Man" to symbol "Man2"
(lr)  ; list all relations
(sav "filename.escad")  ; saves this current view
(export_dot)  ; exports the current view to dot-file
(export_svg)  ; exports the current view to svg-file
(tv)  ; toggle in the other (until now empty) view of escad
(lov "filename.lisp")  ; loads file in this view (now both view's have same content


Future functions
----------------

- further export formats like "GraphML" or "rdf" to interact better with other tools
- analysis tools to get statistics over symbols/relations
- querys based not on query language, but of a model in escad itself.
