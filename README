1. INTRODUCTION
***************

Hello, and welcome to ESCAD.

ESCAD stands for <E>xtendable <S>ymbolic <C>omputer <A>ided <D>escription.
It is a tool which allows you to model parts of the real world in symbolic form.
Therefore it uses 2 objects:
 - Symbols
 - Relations.

Symbols represent things or processes in the real world. For example a "man" could be a symbol.
Relations represent relations between the symbols. For example "is_friend_of" could be a relation between to "man"-symbols.
The whole system is extendable through expansions.

Watch video about escad on it's project page "https://code.google.com/p/escad/wiki/Overview" to get a feeling what is possible
with escad.
